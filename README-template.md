## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

### What I learned

A lot more comfortability working with CSS Grids, SCSS and JQuery. Practice is the key guys so keep grinding.

```html
<!--For the first time, I get familier with writing custom attributes. That made interacting with DOM pretty straight forward with adding any unnecessary classes or ids. Pretty awesome. -->
<img
  src="assets/images/image-product-1.jpg"
  class="pt-img"
  alt="product-img"
  data-img-id="1"
/>
```

### Continued development

- Responsive Design: Still I need a lot of action in designing responsive webpages. That was tha toughest task for me.
- Scalability: This was just for a single product and still took me a lot more time to get around this. So definitely needs to work on this issue.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me to create beautiful box shadows. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
